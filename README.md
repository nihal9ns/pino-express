# Logging with Pino in Express.js

This project demonstrates the use of `Pino` (a logging library for `Node.js`) with `Express.js`. There exists a separate package known as `express-pino-logger` to integrate `Pino` with `Express.js`.

`express-pino-logger` by far seems like the best logging tool for `Express.js`. It has some remarkable benchmarks as compared to other `Node.js` logging tools like `bunyan` and `morgan`.

Check out the benchmark here on it's Github page : https://github.com/pinojs/express-pino-logger

## Installation and Run Guidelines

### npm install -g pino-pretty

`pino-pretty` is used to prettify the log messages on the terminal.

### npm install

### npm start
